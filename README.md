Overview

This project automates repetitive tasks and showcases how to set up a well-structured Python repository with a clear folder hierarchy. It contains:

A main script in src/ for core functionality.

Optional environment setup instructions in requirements.txt (if you choose to add or already have one).

A .gitignore file (optional), ensuring unnecessary files aren’t committed.

A LICENSE file (if present) to specify usage rights and open-source compliance.


Features

File Organizer: If you have code that organizes files, it sorts them by type into separate folders.

Automation Tasks: Demonstrates how to automate daily or system-level tasks.

CLI Interface: Allows you to run commands from your terminal or command prompt.

Modular Design: Potential for easy integration or extension with other Python scripts.

(Adjust features to match your actual script’s functionality!)
